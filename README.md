# FFT_SVG_tracker

This is my attemp to learn webGL. Inspired by one of the video from 3Blue1Brown via [youtube](https://youtu.be/r6sGWTCMz2k?t=1230), I created SVG tracker in which it reads a SVG file, calculates the fourier transform of the path presented in the SVG file and traces the path reading from the SVG file.
